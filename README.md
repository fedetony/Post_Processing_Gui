This tool is Under construction :) , for latest state check [my github][wp] account.

This postprocessing tool is a powerful tool to plot data using matplotlib.

Basically, you can make a general format for plots and you can import different data to have your plots with the same properties.

Features
---------------------------------------
- variable treeView with all plot characteristics to make plots.
- CSV (comma separated not ;) files with data can be read. (Planned other types of data input)
- Select data and plot ranges and possibility to change them.
	- data range 
	- plotted range
	- color range
- Show plot characteristics (colors, labels, colormaps)	
- Selection of same plot structure with different input data
- superimpose different types of plots.
- layout plots with different positions and grids.
- Use predefined styles
- Several types of 2D plots available:
  - scatter
  - contour,contourf 
  - stream
  - bar,barh 
  - quiver
  - barbs
  - plot
  - hist,hist2D
  - Stem
  - eventplot
  - stackplot
  - stairs
  - pie
- Polar projection
- Plot preview
- Functionalities to save figure preview, export or copy to clipboard, save to pdf.
- Auto Save configuration
- reference lines
- math equations and definitions
- Detection of changes in plot structure file shown with a star * 
- Axis annotations 
- Save figs to png or pdf files 
- Evaluate All figs and save to results folder 
- Evaluate All figs and save to results folder as pdf 
- Tool tips to items with selected list restriction showing options
- Highlighting of text
- Icons, and styling of treeview items

To do:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change plot, item ordering? does it matter?
- Finish the 2D plots missing: hexbin, boxplot, heatmap, violin, cohere, specgram, phase_spectrum, magnitude_spectrum...
- Support other projections
- Support tables
- Add additional title prefix legends and labels editing after plot.
- Add annotation Text Notes, spaecific data labels, boxes
- Annotations to hist, eventplot, or special axis plots (partially build not fully implemented)
- include 3D plots (surface, parametric, scatter, contour... etc) https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/3D/index.html
- Save csv of Data plotted
- Add shapes -> 'lines',ellipses,squares.. etc...
- add index to reference df csv data
- Read data form other data sources: xlsx files, dat files and sql
